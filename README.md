# TournaMaker

A web-based tournament and league scheduling application built on the Google Cloud stack. This project utilizes Python2.7 and Google NDB on the backend servers along with React.js on the frontend to create an easy way for groups of people to organize leagues, seasons and tournaments for various sports or competitions.

## Structure

This project is segregated into frontend and backend code. The frontend code is owned by Noah Prisament, and any modifications to that section must be approved by him. The backend code is owned by Cameron Scott, and the same rule applies to modification of it. 

Google AppEngine is used to run this project, so in order to start your own instance you must create a project on Google Cloud Platform and enable AppEngine and Cloud Datastore. You should also install google-cloud-sdk-python in order to develop locally and deploy.
